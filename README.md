# DataScienceBootcamp

This is the repository for my code from the book *Data Science Bootcamp Five Real-World Python Projects* by Leonard Apeltsin

Before The Book:  
I have some expierence in Python, but not too much, so I hope to learn a lot more.   
This book has some very dense Python syntax, so I hope to learn how to read and write it.
